<b>Description:</b> Weather App where you can enter a city and it will give you the current temperature.

<b>Tech Used:</b>ReactJS, Bootstrap

<b>Lessons Learned:</b>I previously built this app using vanilla JS. I wanted to challenge myself and rebuild it using React. I am happy about the way the project turned out and it is very interesting seeing what can be done with React.
